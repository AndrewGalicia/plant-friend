# Plant Directory App

Welcome to the Plant Directory App! This app serves as a comprehensive directory for plant enthusiasts, allowing users to search for their favorite plants, filter them by various criteria, and explore detailed information about each plant. I built this project because I wanted to explore google firebase and see how intuitive it was to host and do other backend functions. The plant API is limited which is why I couldn't built it out more. I also wanted to use bootstrap as a css framework. This project is purely educational.

- **Filtering:** Filter plants by season, indoor/outdoor preference, and more.
- **Plant Details:** Explore detailed information about each plant, including common name, scientific name, and images.
